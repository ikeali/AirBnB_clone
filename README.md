The AirBnB Clone project is a comprehensive effort to build a simplified version of the popular AirBnB platform. The project is structured to lay the foundation for a full web application, encompassing essential components such as HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API integration, and front-end development.

BaseModel Implementation:

Introduction of a parent class named BaseModel responsible for the initialization, serialization, and deserialization of future instances.
Serialization Flow:

Creation of a streamlined flow for serialization/deserialization, involving interactions between instances, dictionaries, JSON strings, and file storage.
Object Classes:

Implementation of specific classes for AirBnB objects (e.g., User, State, City, Place) that inherit from the BaseModel.
File Storage Engine:

Development of the first abstracted storage engine for the project, focusing on file storage.
Unit Testing:

Creation of unit tests to validate the functionality and integrity of all classes and the storage engine.
Project Structure
The project is organized into modular components, each contributing to the overall functionality:

BaseModel:

Manages initialization, serialization, and deserialization.
Object Classes:

User, State, City, Place, and more, inheriting from BaseModel.
File Storage Engine:

FileStorage class handling serialization/deserialization to a file.
Command Interpreter:

console.py providing an interactive and non-interactive shell for managing AirBnB objects
How to Start
To initiate the AirBnB command interpreter, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
$ ./console.py
How to Use
The command interpreter supports various commands, including:

help: Display help information.
quit or EOF: Exit the command interpreter.
For detailed usage instructions, consult the help command within the interpreter.

Examples
Interactive mode:

bash
Copy code
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help
(hbnb) quit
Non-interactive mode:

bash
Copy code
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb) quit
